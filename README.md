music-symfarm
-------------

`music-symfarm` uses the tags stored in music files to create and manage a symlink farm pointing to
them. This allows perfectly tagged, but pathetically organized music collections to be browsed in
any file browser or to be read by applications that require music collections to be in a specific
format.
